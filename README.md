# Monty-Hall-Game
Files to investigate the Monty Hall door swap question
A set of files to explore the Monty Hall door select conundrum.   You have 3 doors with a prize (car) behind one and no prize (goat) behind the other 2.   You pick a door.   Monty then shows you a losing door from the other two and asks you if you want to change your original door to the remaining one.  Is it now a 50:50 chance, should you change?

Calcs.py is a single file that is text based and I used to originally check the workings.
Automatic.py is a single file that allows the system to automatically run the gambit as many times as the user wishes.
m_h_game_animation.py is a graphical game where the user can play in real time and the stats build up at the bottom of the screen.

Have fun.
